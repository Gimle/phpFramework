Gimle phpFramework
==================

Gimle phpFramework is a new project based off [Gimle5](https://github.com/Gimle/Gimle5).

What is new?
------------

* Branching: The master branch will now be the latest stable master. Features will be in feature branches until ready for merge into master.
* Tagging: Versions will be tagged on the master branch.
* Type hinting: All code will now have type hints.
* Documentation: Add more documentation.
* Dependencies: Some more system dependences will be added to improve functionality. All dependencies will be available in .deb format for the latest ubuntu server release.
* Libraries: More libraries will be added in the framework itself instead of in proprietary modules, resulting in a more specific but also more useable framework. One example is a new user management system.
