Gimle phpFramework
==================

Gimle phpFramework is a new project based off [Gimle5](https://github.com/Gimle/Gimle5).

This framework differs a bit from most other frameworks in some ways:

* The site has a public directory for public files. Other files are stored one level up from the public directory.
* Designed to work well with git.
* Designed to be easy to move between environments. No hardcoded locations.
* Small footprint. Focus on wide project support, quick load times with a small framwork that works well with most libraries.
* Designed to be easy to host and maintain.
* Works with apache2, nginx and in cli mode.
* High focus on internationalization.
* Sadly some of these differences has some costs as well. The initial setup process is more complex then most other projects.
* [Documentation](doc/readme.md) is still a work in process, but most implemented features are stable, and the framework is used in production systems.
